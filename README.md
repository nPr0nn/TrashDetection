# TrashDetection

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our final project in the Machine Learning class (MC886) at UNICAMP. In this project, we tackledthe critical issue of trash segmentation using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework. Our goal was to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to enhance waste management processes.

# Dataset

In order to train our model we used the Trash Dataset for Oriented Bounded Box (2023), present on the link: https://universe.roboflow.com/trash-dataset-for-oriented-bounded-box/trash-detection-1fjjc
