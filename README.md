# TrashDetection
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our final project in the Machine Learning class (MC886) at UNICAMP. In this project, we tackled the critical issue of trash segmentation using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework. Our goal was to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to enhance waste management processes.
